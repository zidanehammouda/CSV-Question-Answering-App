For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer\n### Instruction:\ndf is a dataframe about Ford Escort vehicles, containing information about their manufacturing year, mileage in thousands of miles, and price.. df has these columns: ['Year', 'Mileage (thousands)', 'Price']. Write python code that answers this question: Print Plot and save distribution of the prices of 1998 cars \n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame and it has the columns 'Year', 'Mileage (thousands)', 'Price'\n\n# Filter the DataFrame for cars manufactured in 1998\ndf_1998 = df[df['Year'] == 1998]\n\n# Create a histogram of the prices of the 1998 cars\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.histplot(df_1998['Price'], bins=30, kde=True)\nplt.title('Distribution of Prices for 1998 Ford Escort Vehicles')\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Save the plot to a file\nplt.savefig('prices_1998.png')\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code first filters the DataFrame to only include rows where the 'Year' column is 1998. Then it creates a histogram of the 'Price' column for these rows using seaborn's histplot function. The histogram is saved to a file named 'prices_1998.png' and then displayed.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the 'Year' column in your DataFrame is of integer type and that the 'Price' column is of numeric type. If your DataFrame has different column names or types, you will need to adjust the code accordingly.\n<|EOT|>",

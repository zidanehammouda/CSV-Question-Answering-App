For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer\n### Instruction:\ndf is a dataframe about the height and weight measurements of different individuals, indexed from 1.0 onwards.. df has these columns: ['Index', ' Height(Inches)\"', ' \"Weight(Pounds)\"']. Write python code that answers this question: Print Plot the height distribution\n\nHere is the code:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Assuming df is your DataFrame\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Index': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0],\n    'Height(Inches)': [68, 70, 72, 74, 76],\n    'Weight(Pounds)': [160, 170, 180, 190, 200]\n})\n\n# Plotting the height distribution\nplt.hist(df['Height(Inches)'], bins=10, edgecolor='black')\nplt.title('Height Distribution')\nplt.xlabel('Height(Inches)')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis code first imports the necessary libraries, then creates a DataFrame `df` with the given data. It then plots a histogram of the 'Height(Inches)' column using the `matplotlib.pyplot` library. The histogram is divided into 10 bins, and the edges of the bins are marked with black lines. The title of the plot is 'Height Distribution', and the x-axis label is 'Height(Inches)', and the y-axis label is 'Frequency'. Finally, the plot is displayed with `plt.show()`.\n\nPlease replace the DataFrame `df` with your actual DataFrame to get the correct plot.\n<|EOT|>",
